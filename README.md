# Machine Learning: Predict Calorie Expenditure

This repository contains code for predicting calorie expenditure as part of the [Kaggle Playground Series S5E5](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e5) competition. 

The goal is to predict calories burned based on features like `Sex`, `Age`, `Height`, `Weight`, `Duration`, `Heart_Rate`, and `Body_Temp` using machine learning models.

## Current Progress
- **Best Kaggle Score (MAE)**: 0.05909 (public leaderboard)
- **Models Used**: XGBoost, Neural Network (Keras), and Ensemble (50-50 blend)
- **Validation MAE**: ~2.13 (XGBoost), ~0.5-1.5 (Neural Network)
- **Goal**: Improve MAE to <0.05909 through enhanced feature engineering and ensembling.
